## NHANES


National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
  
  - assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States through a combination of **interviews**, **physical examinations**, and **laboratory tests**.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

- Nationally Representative Sample
  - Can make claims about US population
  - Don't forget survey weights!

New measure!


## Map it back to other measures

We had a lot of research on activity counts
- Intuition/cutoffs

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

- Used BLSA data
  - older population, but still had variability 
  - GT3X files had been processed to Activity Counts (AC) (no open source method yet)
  - Used GT3X to create MIMS (MIMSunit R Package)

But what if we didn't need to "train" exactly...


## Estimating Steps Raw Data

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- `stepcount` (May 25, 2021 initial commit): @small2024self
  - estimate step counts from raw wrist-worn data to 10-second level
- Uses Self-Supervised Learning (unlabeled and scalable)
- Applied to UK Biobank then refined on OxWalk [@oxwalk_data]
- Performance on other datasets and compared to other open-source step counting algorithms?

## Compare to Gold Standard

@koffman2024evaluating estimates steps using 3 gold standard data sets: OxWalk [@oxwalk_data], MAREA [@marea], and Clemson [@clemson_data]

- iPhone video/force sensitive resistors in shoes/ground facing gold standard

```{r}
include_figure("images/comparison_data.png")
```



## Compare to Gold Standard

@koffman2024evaluating estimates steps from 5 methods on this data:

```{r}
include_figure("images/comparison_methods.png")
```



## Takehome: stepcount SSL not bad

- `stepcount` (SSL version) good for most data/metric:

```{r}
include_figure("images/comparison_results.png")
```


## Apply to NHANES

@koffman2024comparing applies those methods to NHANES.

Wildly different estimates! 

```{r}

## Apply to NHANES

Fairly high correlation between methods

```{r}
include_figure("images/correlation.png")
```


## Apply to NHANES

And more predictive of 5-year mortality (even than AC/MIMS)

```{r}
include_figure("images/nhanes_steps_plot.png")
```

## Apply to NHANES 

Dose response relationship between steps and mortality

```{r}
include_figure("images/dose_response.png")
```

## Apply to NHANES 

**Takehome** 

- Steps from different algorithms in NHANES correlated and highly predictive of mortality, but very different in absolute value
- Steps more interpretable for general public than AC or MIMS, but only if we can better define or harmonize what is a "step"

- Still need more large, open training data! 

- Still need mapping between ``stepcount`` steps, Apple/FitBit steps, "true" steps

## What about a Disease Group (e.g. Parkinson's)

## Parkinson's Disease in NHANES


```{r df_park, echo = FALSE}
df_pd = readr::read_rds(here::here("data", "df_prescribed_parkinsons.rds"))
df_pd = df_pd %>% 
  filter(has_accel) %>% 
  mutate(
    both = is_parkinsons_2021_prescribed & is_parkinsons_prescribed,
    either = is_parkinsons_2021_prescribed | is_parkinsons_prescribed
  )
```

Anywhere from `r sum(df_pd$both)` to  `r sum(df_pd$either)` classified PD out of `r sum(df_pd$has_accel)` that have any accelerometry data.

Look at https://github.com/jhuwit/nhanes_derivatives/blob/main/R/estimate_parkinsons.R
 for example code:

```{r df_park_table, echo = TRUE}
df_pd %>% filter(has_accel) %>% 
  # is_parkinsons_prescribed - any ANTI-PARKINSONS
  # is_parkinsons_2021_prescribed - in the codes from supplement
  count(is_parkinsons_2021_prescribed, is_parkinsons_prescribed) %>% 
  gt::gt()
```


## Mean Number of Steps per Day for PD

If you filter for 1368 (95% of a day of "good minutes), we can estimate the mean/SD number of steps in the PD group:

```{r}
steps = readr::read_rds(here::here("data", "nhanes_pd_scsslsteps.rds"))
steps %>% 
  group_by(SEQN, PAXDAYM) %>%
  summarise(n_steps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE), 
            n_minutes = sum(!is.na(steps)), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  filter(n_minutes >= 1368) %>% 
  summarise(across(n_steps, list(mean = base::mean, sd = stats::sd))) 
```
