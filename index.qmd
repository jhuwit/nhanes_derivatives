## NHANES


National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
  
  - assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States through a combination of **interviews**, **physical examinations**, and **laboratory tests**.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

- Nationally Representative Sample
  - Can make claims about US population
  - Don't forget survey weights!
- Continuously in 2-year cycles
- Lots of Data

## NHANES Summary: MIMS

Monitor-independent movement summary for accelerometer data [@john2019open]

```{r}

New measure!


## Map it back to other measures

We had a lot of research on activity counts
- Intuition/cutoffs

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

- Used BLSA data
  - older population, but still had variability 
  - GT3X files had been processed to Activity Counts (AC) (no open source method yet)
  - Used GT3X to create MIMS (MIMSunit R Package)

```{r}

# Rewind 5 years

## BIRS 2020: Feb 26, 2020

Almost 5 years to today!

BIRS conference: [Use of Wearable and Implantable Devices in Health Research](https://workshops.birs.ca/events/20w5109/schedule)

Schedule: 
https://workshops.birs.ca/events/20w5109/schedule

```

- Waiting on Raw Data!

Recorded Videos:

::: {.notes}
Looking back we can see we needed a few things to happen
:::



# Then COVID Happened

# Including a Failed Startup (for John)

# And Deep Learning Made Strides


## Back from Leave of Absence

Identify individuals from wrist acceleromtery during walking ("fingerprinting") 
[@koffman2023fingerprinting], want to scale to large, population-based study 

- But need delineated walking and raw data


```{r}
include_figure("images/fingerprint.jpg")
```



## 2022: A Number of Things Happen

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

- Release of NHANES Raw Data

## NHANES Data Part Deux

Raw data Available

- 80Hz
- $>$ 1Tb compressed!
- **Hourly** CSVs and a log file

## NHANES Data Part Deux

- [x] Publicly available raw data
- [x] Open source algorithms 
- [x] Computating power and storage space to apply algorithms 
- [x] Results...

## Still True Today...Mostly

But what if we didn't need to "train" exactly...


## Estimating Steps on Raw Data

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- `stepcount` (May 25, 2021 initial commit): @small2024self
  - estimate step counts from raw wrist-worn data to 10-second level
- Uses Self-Supervised Learning (unlabeled and scalable)
- Applied to UK Biobank then refined on OxWalk [@oxwalk_data]
- Performance on other datasets and compared to other open-source step counting algorithms?

## Compare to Gold Standard

@koffman2024evaluating estimates steps using 3 gold standard data sets: OxWalk [@oxwalk_data], MAREA [@marea], and Clemson [@clemson_data]

- iPhone video/force sensitive resistors in shoes/ground facing gold standard

```{r}
include_figure("images/comparison_data.png")
```



## Compare to Gold Standard

@koffman2024evaluating estimates steps from 5 methods on this data:

```{r}
include_figure("images/comparison_methods.png")
```



## Takehome: stepcount SSL not bad

- `stepcount` (SSL version) good for most data/metrics:

```{r}
include_figure("images/comparison_results.png")
```

## Takehome: stepcount SSL not bad

- `stepcount` (SSL version) good for most data/metrics:

```{r}
include_figure("images/truth_predicted_steps.png")
```


## Apply to NHANES

@koffman2024comparing applies those methods to NHANES.

Wildly different estimates! 

```{r}
include_figure("images/nhanes_steps_table.png")
```

## Apply to NHANES

Mostly similar patterns by age 

```{r}
include_figure("images/nhanes_steps.png")
```

## Apply to NHANES

Fairly high correlation between methods

```{r}
include_figure("images/correlation.png")

```


## Apply to NHANES

And more predictive of 5-year mortality (even than AC/MIMS)

```{r}
include_figure("images/nhanes_steps_plot.png")
```

## Apply to NHANES 

Dose response relationship between steps and mortality

```{r}
include_figure("images/dose_response.png")
```

## Apply to NHANES 

**Takehome** 

- Steps from different algorithms in NHANES correlated and highly predictive of mortality, but very different in absolute value
- Steps more interpretable for general public than AC or MIMS, but only if we can better define or harmonize what is a "step"

- Still need more large, open training data! 

- Still need mapping between ``stepcount`` steps, Apple/Fitbit steps, "true" steps

## Data Available for Use - PhysioNet

The data is available (more derivatives to come):

- Actilife (from Actigraph) [@ActiLife]

- ADEPT [@adept]

- Oak [@oak]

- Verisense (x2) [@verisense_2022], [@verisense_github]
